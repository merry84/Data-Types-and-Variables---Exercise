//Create a program, which sums the ASCII codes of n characters and prints the sum on the console. 
//Input 
//•	On the first line, you will receive n – the number of lines, which will follow. 
//•	On the next n lines – you will receive letters from the Latin alphabet. 
//Output 
//Print the total sum in the following format: 
//"The sum equals: {totalSum}"
//Constraints
//•	n will be in the interval [1…20].
//•	The characters will always be either upper or lower-case letters from the English alphabet. 
//•	You will always receive one letter per line.
