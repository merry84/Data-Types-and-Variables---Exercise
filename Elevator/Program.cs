﻿//Calculate how many courses will be needed to elevate n persons by using an elevator of the capacity of p persons.
//The input holds two lines:
//the number of people n and the capacity p of the elevator. 

//Hints
//•	You should divide n by p. This gives you the number of full courses (e.g. 17 / 3 = 5). 
//•	If n does not divide p without a remainder, you will need one additional partially full course (e.g. 17 % 3 = 2). 
//•	Another approach is to round up n / p to the nearest integer (ceiling), e.g. 17 / 3 = 5.67 → rounds up to 6. 
//•	Sample code for the round-up calculation: 


int persons = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
int capacity = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
int course = (int)Math.Ceiling((double)persons/ capacity);
Console.WriteLine(course);
